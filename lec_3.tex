I'd like to define a representaiton today, since we have all the requisite knowledge.
The crux of the problem is this: group multiplication is hard.
It's generally undecidable whether a given group element is even the identity.
But if we can translate a group's multiplication into something more concrete (like matrices!),
then we can learn a lot more about the group.

We'll begin by recalling that a homomorphism between groups $G$ and $H$ 
is a function $f:G\to H$ satisfying \[ f(ab) = f(a)f(b). \]
